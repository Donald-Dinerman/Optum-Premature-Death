# Premature Death Prediction Model Using Health Behavior Data

## Affiliation

This project was completed in a joint data science program with 
Optum and Carnegie Mellon University.

## Objective

The objective is to predict premature deaths using county level 
health behavior data. We also sought to determine the most 
influential particular health behaviors in modeling premature 
deaths.

## Data

Our data set was gathered from the [County Health Rankings Model](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/measures-data-sources/county-health-rankings-model?componentType=factor-area&componentId=3). 
This data is gathered by the University of Wisconsin Population 
Health Institute. This data contains community health information 
across 2,853 US counties that emphasizes the many factors that 
influence how long and how well we live.

## Deployment

The project report includes our motivation, data description,
exploratory data analysis, modeling methods, results, and 
conclusions.

The Shiny App hosts an interactive UI with our predictive model 
and US maps with health behavior and premature death 
geographical distributions.
